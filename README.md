# Autonorous - Your Personal Sight Reading Trainer 

This was made for HoyaHacks 2019, and we were the winner for the Social Innovation track.
(We were originally going to do the music track, but this track dissappeared when the sponsor apparently dropped last minute, so the judges just awarded us this track)
